<!-- # 🎯 Dynamic Customer Feedback System

## Overview
The testimonials section is now **dynamic** and pulls real customer feedback from the database instead of static content. Customers can submit feedback, and owners can moderate it.

## ✨ Features

### For Customers:
- **Submit Feedback**: Rate your experience (1-5 stars) and leave comments
- **View Testimonials**: See real feedback from other customers
- **Authentication Required**: Must be logged in to submit feedback
- **One Feedback Per User**: Each user can only submit one feedback

### For Owners:
- **Moderate Feedback**: Approve or reject customer feedback
- **View All Feedback**: See pending, approved, and rejected feedback
- **Owner Dashboard**: Access via `/owner/manage-feedback` route

## 🚀 How It Works

### 1. Customer Feedback Flow:
1. Customer visits home page
2. Clicks "Share Your Experience" button in testimonials section
3. If not logged in → Shows "Please login to continue" toast
4. If logged in → Opens feedback form modal
5. Customer rates experience (1-5 stars) and writes comment
6. Feedback is submitted and stored in database
7. Admin can review and moderate the feedback

### 2. Owner Moderation Flow:
1. Owner accesses `/owner/manage-feedback` route
2. Views all submitted feedback with status (pending/approved/rejected)
3. For pending feedback, can click "Approve" or "Reject"
4. Approved feedback appears on home page testimonials
5. Rejected feedback is hidden from public view
